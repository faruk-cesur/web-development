<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In 2017, I began my career in accounting and human resources. With the experience I gained in these fields, I decided to pivot to software development in 2021. During this transition, I learned the C# programming language and honed my skills in mobile game development using the Unity Engine.</p>

<p>My strong command of technology and solution-oriented thinking enable me to adapt quickly to different areas and bring new perspectives to my work. I have a keen commitment to personal development and continuously strive to enhance my knowledge and skills.</p>

<p>Teamwork is indispensable for me; I enjoy exchanging knowledge with my colleagues and collaborating to achieve common goals.</p>

<p>My objective is to leverage my interest in technology to create innovative solutions and to make significant contributions in a continuously evolving industry by further advancing my skills.</p>
